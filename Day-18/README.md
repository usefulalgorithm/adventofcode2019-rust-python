# Day 16

Traveling salesman-like optimization problem (**Warning:** Total spaghetti code).

## Python

206 lines of code.

```bash
$ time python sol.py
Part one: 4700
Part two: 2260

real	0m7.458s
user	0m7.452s
sys	0m0.004s
```



## Rust

309 lines of code.

```bash
$ time ./target/release/sol
Part one: 4700
Part two: 2260

real	0m1.131s
user	0m1.124s
sys	0m0.004s
```

## Development differences

My solution is so ugly that it took ages to debug in Rust...
